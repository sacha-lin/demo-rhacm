# Exercise 2 - Managing an existing cluster using Advanced Cluster Management

In this exercise you manage the existing cluster on the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management stack - `local-cluster`. You will attach labels to the cluster, visualize its resources and perform updates to the OpenShift Platform.


## 2.1 Import an existing cluster

1. Modify the attributes of the managed cluster in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management -
*   **Name**: local-cluster
*   **labels**: 
    * environment=dev
    * owner=&lt;your-name>
    
In order to associate the labels with local-cluster, follow the next steps -

*   Navigate to **Cluster Lifecycle** -> **local-cluster** -> **Actions** -> **Edit labels**.
*   Add the labels.

2. Log into the cluster using the **oc** cli tool.

```
<managed cluster> $ oc login -u <admin-user> -p <password> https://api.cluster.2222.sandbox.opentlc.com:6443
```

3. Make sure that all of the agent pods are up and running on the cluster.

```
<managed cluster> $ oc get pods -n open-cluster-management-agent

<managed cluster> $ oc get pods -n open-cluster-management-agent-addon

```

## 2.2 Analyzing the managed cluster

In this exercise you will be using the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management portal to analyze the managed clusterâ€™s resources.

1. Using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management, find out what is the cloud provider of the managed cluster.
2. Using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management, find out the number of nodes that make up the managed cluster. How many CPUs does each node have?
3. Using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management, check out whether all users can provision new projects on local-cluster (check if the **self-provisioners** ClusterRoleBinding has the system:authenticated:oauth group associated with it).
4. Using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management, check what **channel version** is associated with local-cluster (stable / candidate / fast) - (Search for **kind:ClusterVersion** CR).
5. Using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management -
*   Check the port number that the **alertmanager-main-0** pod listens on local-cluster (can be found using the pod logs and pod resource definition).
*   Check the full path of the **alertmanager-main-0** pod configuration file (can be found using the pod logs and pod resource definition).


## 2.3 Upgrade the cluster using Advanced Cluster Management

**NOTE**: Do this exercise towards the end of the day. The upgrading process may take up to an hour to complete.

1. Change the **channel version** on the local-cluster from stable-**4.x** to stable-**4.x+1**.
2. Upgrade the cluster using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management.
